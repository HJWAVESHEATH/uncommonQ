    <h1>AI With Accountability</h1>
    <p>Why transparency, auditability, and intent define the future of intelligent systems.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article-body">
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is not a consciousness waiting to replace us—it is an amplifier of
      whatever logic we embed inside it.  When we give it our reasoning, our data, and our biases,
      it simply returns them at scale.  The question is no longer whether AI can think, but whether
      <em>we can still explain why it thinks what it does</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Accountability as Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      In my work, every algorithm is built with an audit trail.  Inputs, transformations,
      and outcomes are all versioned like line items in a ledger.  That discipline comes from
      accounting: if a balance sheet must reconcile, so must a model.  When AI decisions affect
      credit, healthcare, or markets, documentation isn’t bureaucracy—it’s the foundation of trust.
    </p>

    <h2>The Human Loop</h2>
    <p>
      I design systems that invite human review rather than obscure it.
      A model’s output should start a conversation, not end one.
      True intelligence happens when analysts, domain experts, and algorithms form a feedback
      loop that learns faster <em>and</em> explains itself better each iteration.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsible Power</h2>
    <p>
      AI’s advantage is speed; its danger is detachment.
      I believe the next era of analytics belongs to practitioners who pair
      machine precision with moral clarity—professionals willing to say,
      “Show me the reasoning.”  That philosophy guides every framework I build.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Accountability isn’t an afterthought—it’s a design constraint.
       Every model should be able to answer: who taught me, what do I know, and why do I believe it?”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Our Operating Principle</h2>
    <p>
      In the Hjermstad Quant framework, AI is a collaborator:
      a disciplined assistant that handles scale while people handle meaning.
      Its role is to make judgment measurable, not mechanical.
      The goal is coherence—systems that think clearly,
      communicate their logic, and leave a verifiable trail of intent.
    </p>

    <p class="closing-note">
      This is how we earn the right to automate: by building machines that remember what integrity looks like.
