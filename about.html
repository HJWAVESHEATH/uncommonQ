        <h2>Early Foundations</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up surrounded by engines, invoices, and integrity.
          My parents—an automotive technician and a dealership accountant—taught me that precision and honesty are two sides of the same tool.
          I learned to talk shop with both the crew on the floor and the finance office upstairs.
          That dual fluency in technical and business language still drives every decision I make.
        </p>

        <h2>Sales and Service</h2>
        <p>
          Before university, I spent a decade as a top service advisor across a multi-dealer network.
          The lessons were human: clarity beats jargon, and trust converts better than pressure.
          I discovered how data, emotion, and timing shape every decision—skills that translate directly into model communication and behavioral finance.

        <h2>Finance & Accounting</h2>
        <p>
          Earning my degree in Accounting and completing nearly all requirements for the CPA exams refined my thinking in controls, audit trails, and risk.
          To me, a model is an income statement in motion—inputs, transformations, and outputs that must reconcile.
          The balance sheet always has to balance, whether it’s numbers or probabilities.

        <h2>Quantitative Systems Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Today I build frameworks that combine mathematics, data science, and business logic.
          My goal isn’t only predictive accuracy but <em>explainable performance</em>—systems that justify their behavior and earn stakeholder trust.
          The tools may be modern, but the values are traditional: accountability, curiosity, and craftsmanship.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="mission">Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To design intelligent systems that strengthen human decision-making.
      To use AI responsibly, transparently, and always with the goal of coherence—linking numbers, people, and outcomes into one understandable narrative.
    </p>

    <h2 class="values">Core Values</h2>
    <ul class="values-list">
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Every calculation should be explainable and reproducible.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Data work is an ethical act—honesty is the highest precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Questioning assumptions uncovers both error and opportunity.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The best models are the ones that people can understand.</li>
    </ul>
